# BoupouchiSB
The Spring Boot project focuses on the efficient management of "categorie" (category) and "article" entities, leveraging key technologies such as JEE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition), Swagger, Spring Boot, JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), and Postman for seamless development and integration. This project is designed to provide a robust solution for organizing and categorizing articles within distinct categories, enhancing data management and retrieval. The following overview sheds light on the project's key components and technologies:

 Core Entities:
Categorie (Category): This entity represents the categories to which articles belong. It serves as an organizational unit to classify and group related articles.
Article: The Article entity encapsulates information about individual articles. Each article is associated with a specific category, linking the two entities in a meaningful manner.
